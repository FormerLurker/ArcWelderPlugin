If *Use Octoprint Printer Settings* is unchecked, **Arc Welder** will use this setting to determine if the G90/G91 command influences your extruder's axis mode.  In general, Marlin 2.0 and forks should have this box checked.  Many forks of Marlin 1.x should have this unchecked, like the Prusa MK2 and MK3.  I will try to add a list of printers and the proper value for this setting at some point, as well as a gcode test script you can use to determine what setting to use.  Keep in mind that most slicers produce code that will work fine no matter what setting you choose here.  Default: Disabled
