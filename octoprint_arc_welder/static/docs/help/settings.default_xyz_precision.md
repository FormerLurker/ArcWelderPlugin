Note:  If this setting is too high, you may encounter checksum errors depending on your firmware.  Also, if you set this value below 3 , *Arc Welder* will set this to 3.  If you set this value above 6, *Arc Welder* will set it to 6.  If the setting is not a valid value, it will be set to the default of 3.
