 Arcwelder can automatically select the processed file after completion when possible.  The available options are:

 * *Always* - The target file will always be selected after processing.
 * *Uploaded Files* - Only uploaded files will be selected after processing.
 * *Disabled* - The target file will never be selected.

Note: Arcwelder can only select the target file if OctoPrint is not printing.
