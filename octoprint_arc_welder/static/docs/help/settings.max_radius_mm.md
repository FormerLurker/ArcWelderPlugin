Arc Welder will produce arcs whenever it can, including arcs with an extremely large radius (many kilometers).  This typically won't cause any issues, but it's unlikely that the geometry of any 3d printed object contains arcs of this size.  Using the 'Max Radius' setting you can control and eliminate these arcs if you choose.

The default setting is **1000000 mm** or **1KM**.
