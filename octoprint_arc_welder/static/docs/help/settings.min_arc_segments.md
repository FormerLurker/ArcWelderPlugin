This setting can be used as a workaround for firmware that tends to draw arc with a very small radius as a flat edge or an obvious polygon.  It controls how many segments should appear for a full circle of the same radius as the arc.  For older versions and forks of Marlin (including all current Prusa firmware), I recommend a value of 12 here.

This will only work if *MM Per Arc Segment* is also greater than zero.  **Only set this if you know you need it!**.  Default: 12
