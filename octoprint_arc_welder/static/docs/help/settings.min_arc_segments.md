This setting can be used as a workaround for firmware that tends to draw arc with a very small radius as a flat edge or an obvious polygon.  It controls how many segments should appear for a full circul of the same radius as the arc.

This will only work if *mm per arc segment** is also greater than zero.  **Only set this if you know you need it!**.  Default: 0 = disabled
