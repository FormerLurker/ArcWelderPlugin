This setting can be used as a workaround for firmware that tends to draw arc with a very small radius as a flat edge or an obvious polygon.  It controls how many segments should appear for a full circle of the same radius as the arc.  This should **ONLY** be enabled if your firmware has known issues printing arcs, or if you cannot recompile yoru firmware with appropriate arc interpolation settings.  Enabling firmware compensation will reduce compression.

If you enable this feature, be sure to read the help (blue question mark) next to the *Minimum Arc Segments* and *MM Per Arc Segment* settings!
