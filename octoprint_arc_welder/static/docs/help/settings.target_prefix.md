When *Overwrite Source File* is disabled, **Arc Welder** will produce a new file with this prefix.  For example, if you use **AW_** as your prefix, and your source file is called **print.gcode** the output file would be called **AW_print.gcode**.  Default:  NO PREFIX

Note: You can combine prefixes and postfixes if you like.
