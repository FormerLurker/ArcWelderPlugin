This setting can be used as a workaround for firmware that tends to draw arc with a very small radius as a flat edge or an obvious polygon.

This will only work if *mm per arc segment** is also greater than zero.  **Only set this if you know you need it!**.  If you do need to set this, it should be set to the mm_per_arc_segment setting in your firmware.  Default: 0 = disabled
