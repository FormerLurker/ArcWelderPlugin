Arc support was first included in v0.8.0, so if you are running an older version, you will need to upgrade if you want to use Arc Welder.  I recommend using at least v0.9.0, which includes some Arc fixes and improvements.

Klipper, can crank out some very high resolution arcs very quickly.  The *gcode_arcs* config section must be enabled in order for Arc Welder to work.
