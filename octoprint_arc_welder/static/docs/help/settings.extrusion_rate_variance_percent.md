If the extrusion rate varies along a given arc by more than this percent, the arc will be aborted.  This setting was added to support variable line widths (Cura Arachne).  The default value of 5% is experimental, and the optimal value will depend on your slicer settings.  However it is acceptable for non-variable width prints.

Higher values will result in more arcs being created, and lower values will produce more accurate line widths.
