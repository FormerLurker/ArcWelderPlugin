When *Overwrite Source File* is disabled   **Arc Welder** will produce a new file with this postfix before the file extension.  For example, if you use **.aw** for your postfix, and your source file is called **print.gcode** the resulting file would be called **print.aw.gcode**.  Default: .aw

Note: You can combine prefixes and postfixes if you like.
