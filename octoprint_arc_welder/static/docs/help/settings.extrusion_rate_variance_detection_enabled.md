If the extrusion rate varies along a given arc by more than this percent, the arc will be aborted.  This setting was added to support variable line widths (Cura Arachne), though I've learned it's pretty common for many existing slicers to vary the extrusion rate.

The default value of 5% is experimental, and the optimal value will depend on your slicer settings.  Higher values will result in more arcs being created, and lower values will produce more accurate line widths.
