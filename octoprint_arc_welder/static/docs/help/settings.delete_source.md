 Arc Welder can automatically delete the source file for you.  The available options are:

 * *Always Delete Source File* - The source file will always be deleted after processing is completed.
 * *Delete After Automatic Processing* - Automatically processed source files will be deleted, but manually processed source files will *NOT* be deleted.
 * *Delete After Manual Processing* - Only manually processed source files will be deleted.
 * *Disabled* - The source file will not be deleted.

Arcwelder can only delete the source file if it is not printing.

If the ```Overwrite Source File``` option is enabled, the source file will be overwritten with the processed file.
