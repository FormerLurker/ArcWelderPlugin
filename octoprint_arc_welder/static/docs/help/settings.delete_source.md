 Arc Welder can automatically delete the source file for you.  This will not occur if the source file is overwritten by the target file.  The available options are:

 * *Always* - The source file will always be deleted after processing is completed if possible.
 * *Disabled* - The source file will not be deleted.

Arcwelder can only delete the source file if it is not printing.

If the ```Overwrite Source File``` option is enabled, the source file will be overwritten with the processed file.
